<body>
    <p>I'm seeking an entry-level position in a dynamic organization to start my career, improve my knowledge and skills, and contribute to the organization's success. <br />I'm currently working on a crash study plan to master full stack development, dedicating 4 hours a day and a full day on Sundays to this goal.<br /> Additionally, I'm developing a Weather Prediction Application for my final year engineering project and planning to build a notes web application soon.</p>
